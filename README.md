# Object-Oriented Programming Project 🖥️👨‍💻

## Project Topic 📚
Generative library for managing microcontroller peripherals like GPIO.

## Build Instructions

The project uses the **CMake** build system and requires a compiler compatible with the **C++20** standard.

To correctly build the project, execute the following commands in the command line from the project’s root directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
## IMPORTANT
To successfully compile the project and run the unit tests, an additional dependency must be installed.

You can install the required tool by running the following command in the command line:

```bash
sudo apt install doctest-dev
```
## Build Output
After a successful build, the following executable files will be generated:

Executable demonstrating example application usage
```bash
./GPIO_Lib_Project
```

Executable used to run unit tests
```bash
./GPIO_Lib_Project_test 
```
